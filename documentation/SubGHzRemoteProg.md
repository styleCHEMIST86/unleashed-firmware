### Coding using an existing remote
To enter the code of a new remote control without using your receiver, you will need
an authorised remote control (note: the first remote control must always be entered
using the receiver key). Now, with the two remote controls (your already coded
remote, and your new remote), which we shall call NEW (the one whose code we want
to enter) and OLD (the authorised one), position yourself within 3m of the gate/garage
receiver and then:
1. Press and hold the `Send` button on the flipper for at least 5 seconds and then
release.
2. Press the button on the already programmed remote 3 times slowly.
3. Press the `Send` button on the flipper slowly and then release.

### Coding directly to your receiver
Your new remote will program to your receiver as per your original remote
instructions, so please refer to your manual. But for a typical NICE FLOX2R Receiver,
the programming procedure is as follows:
1. Press the learning button on your receiver for 1-2 seconds. The LED will turn on
for 5 seconds. Within 5 seconds, complete the next step.
2. Press a `Send` button on your flipper until the LED on your receiver turns off.
3. Release the remote button and wait for 2 seconds.
4. Press the `Send` button on your flipper again. The LED on your receiver
will now flash 3 times. This indicates that your remote has been successfully
coded. If this does not happen, repeat the whole procedure from the
beginning, and try again.
5. Wait 5 seconds. Press the button on your new remote to test if it opens your
garage/gate.
